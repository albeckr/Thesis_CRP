# Thesis_CoRoDro

Contains the code for my master thesis project at the University of Mannheim.
Idea is to use multi- agent Reinforcement Learning for distributed control of agents with different capabilities in a parcel delivery setup.

All the implemented Code is in Jupyter Notebooks.
Notebooks are grouped by the kind of experiments that were conducted and are saved with the trained model for reproducability of the evaluation and results.


### How to run

For the dependencies and versions used see the [here](./requirements.txt).
