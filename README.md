# Thesis_CRP

Contains the code for my master thesis project with the title "Application and Evaluation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approaches for the Coordinated Routing of Drones" at the University of Mannheim.
Idea is to use multi- agent Reinforcement Learning for distributed control of agents with different capabilities in a parcel delivery setting.

All the implemented Code can be found in Jupyter Notebooks.
Notebooks are grouped by the kind of experiments that were conducted and are saved with the trained model for reproducability of the evaluation and results.

For a detailed description of the content of this repository see the thesis pdf document, especially the chapters on Experiments and Implementation of the environment.
